# The Grengiols–Saflischtal Photovoltaic Solar Farm: an Independent Analysis

Dated : October 26, 2022

With the current energy crisis affecting Europe and Switzerland in particular, efficient new generations of electric power are urgently needed. In this context, a number of proposals has been put forward to increase our country’s renewable electricity production. One such project is the Grengiols–Saflischtal solar power plant. The project is still in an early developmental stage and quantitatively reliable numbers for power production capacity and annual energy generation do not truly exist. Given a potential area of 5 km2, an upper bound for the plant’s peak power is in the 1 GWp range, which, given the plant’s location and panel orientation may generate as much as 1.5 TWh to 2 TWh annually for bifacial photovoltaic panels. These numbers sound rather optimistic, but regardless of their accuracy, electric power generation in the range of hundreds of megawatts can only be injected into the grid at extra-high voltages of 220kV or 380kV, therefore, a question that naturally arises is whether Switzerland’s transmission grid can safely absorb this additional power injection.
In this report, we evaluate the maximal peak electric power that a large solar photovoltaic farm in the Grengiols– Saflischtal area could safely inject into Switzerland’s extra-high voltage grid, without jeopardizing its stability. We consider two different grids: (i) the current extra-high voltage grid operated by Swissgrid as of October 2022, and (ii) Swissgrid’s strategic grid 2025, which will be finalized no earlier than 2028. Our main findings are that:
- When completed, Swissgrid’s strategic grid 2025 will be able to absorb more than 1GWp of photovoltaic peak power injection at Mörel’s substation, but not at Fiesch. This is so, because Mörel is a “hub” between 380kV and 220kV so that an injection at 380kV can be transmitted on two lines, east- and westward, each with a capacity of ∼1.7GW, and additionally to the level through a 700MW transformer. The Fiesch substation on the other hand only connects to the 220 kV line and accordingly has a significantly smaller power capacity.
- Without either the westward 380 kV line from Mörel to Chippis or the eastward 380 kV from Mörel to Lavorgo (via Ulrichen and Airolo), it is not possible to absorb 1 GWp at Mörel’s substation. Therefore, Switzerland’s current extra-high voltage grid may safely absorb 300 MWp , but not much more than that. Injection at the Fiesch substation would be further restricted.
- An extra-high voltage power line needs to be constructed to connect the plant to a substation on Swissgrid’s transmission grid.
According to Swissgrid, the Chippis-Mörel 380 kV line will be completed no earlier than 2028, while construction of the Airolo-Lavorgo 380 kV line will not start before 2024. We therefore conclude that the project, with its announced potential of 2GWp, cannot be completed/connected to the grid before at least 2028. A scaled-down project with a power production around 300 MWp could be connected to the currently operational extra-high voltage grid.
Complete feasibility studies should investigate further necessary infrastructures such as (i) the power line necessary to connect the photovoltaic farm to the transmission grid, (ii) large-scale converters and other essential power elec- tronics infrastructures necessary to inject current into the power grid and (iii) possible electric storage solutions to smoothen power injections into the transmission grid.
